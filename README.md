## What was the brief?

In this exame we were given the task of developing a headless Wordpress REST API blog, of our chosen topic. The site should become a functional, well presented website written with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We should take in to practis all the things we have learn over the first year of our study. There were several criteria to be met, such as a carousel with "Latest Posts", modal popup, fetch dynamically both bloglist and blogpost, create a form with javascript validation aso. Everything with neat semantic, responsiveness and CSS after the DRY principles. The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
We were not allowed to use any framework, so I did all the coding myself.

## What was my experience?

The process was exiting, due to a one week setback because of the flu. Of the five weeks process, i was down on one of the week. Becuse of this, I had to reduce the amount of functionallity i had planned to be able to deliver at deadline. Even the setback, I am so happy I was able to meet all the requirements and a bit more, in time! I also got several and great feedback from my tutor and peers, that helped me along the way, bettering my design and code.
